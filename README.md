## ðŸ”§ Dependencies

Ensure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/) >= v22. I like to use pnpm to manage dependencies, but npm, bun or yarn will work as well.

## ðŸš€ Setup and Running

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:dcrgll/train-times.git
   ```

2. (Optional) Ensure you're on Node v22 or higher:

   ```bash
   node --version
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Setup environment variables:

   Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and fill in the necessary values.

There is more documentation on the environment variables in the example file.

5. Start the application:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

By default, the application should be available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
